# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The overall Kickstarter project was to help Louise start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play Fever.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to examine how different theater campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

This analysis was begun by utilizing a dataset comprised of various different types of crowdfunded campaigns spanning the years 2010-2017. Being that the focus of this analysis centered around theater campaigns, it was necessary to filter the overall dataset accordingly. After converting the Unix timestamps to dates I was able to establish the year for each record. I then pivoted the data with it filtered on the theater campaigns broken out by their outcomes (successful, failed, canceled). Next, I created a chart (below) from the pivot in order to easily visualize the theater campaign outcomes in relation to their launch dates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
